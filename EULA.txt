non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use NovaBridge in internal and
commercial projects.

You may distribute your compiled project outputs that include NovaBridge at
runtime, as permitted by your purchase channel terms.

  files on a standalone basis.
- Remove copyright or ownership notices.
- Use NovaBridge in violation of applicable law or third-party license terms.

6. Support and Updates

best-effort basis and may change by release tier (including Early Access).

7. Refunds
For marketplace purchases, refund handling follows marketplace policy.
For direct purchases, refund policy follows `SUPPORT.md` and any written sales
terms.

8. Termination
If you materially breach this EULA, your license terminates automatically.
Upon termination, you must cease use and delete unlicensed copies.
